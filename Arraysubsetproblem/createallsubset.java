// subset are means we can select all the ele of an array or one we can also choose who have gap btw them like if arr={1,2,3}
// subset are {},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}
// subsequence -> same as subset but order remain in a {sequnce like same arr as above 
// and subsequnce are {},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{2,3},{1,3},{1,2,3}
// subset contiguous we cannot pick element having space btw them like we will get [],[1],[2],[3],[1,2],[2,3],[1,2,3]
